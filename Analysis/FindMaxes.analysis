- Initializing Variables:
    - assigning values to arrays `max` and `min`.
    - Time complexity: T(1).
- For Loop:
    - Iterates through the array from i=0 to n-1 --> [T(n-1)] 
    - sum equation (Î£) from  i=0 to n-1  add 1 everytime = upper-lower+1  =  (n-1) - 0 + 1 = n  --> [ T(n) ] 
- Finding Max Element:
    - Within the loop, comparisons are made to find the maximum and minimum elements
    - Time complexity: T(1) for each comparison.
- Comparison of Products and Return Maximum Product:
     - arithmetic comparison takes constant time T(1).
     - conditional statement (`if-else`) takes constant time T(1)


-  Total:
    -  T( n-1 ) + c  = T(n)  

 - Time Complexity:
     - O(n)
